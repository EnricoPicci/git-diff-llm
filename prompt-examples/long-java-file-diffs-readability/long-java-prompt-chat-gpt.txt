In the file long-java-file.txt there is the original QuietanzamentoAdapter.java content.

The changes applied to the original QuietanzamentoAdapter.java file in the format of Git diffs are in the file long-java-diffs.txt. In other words, the changes are in the format of lines that have been removed and lines that have been added. The lines that have been removed are prefixed with a minus sign (-) and the lines that have been added are prefixed with a plus sign (+). The unchanged lines are not shown.

Summarize these changes in not more than three sentences.
